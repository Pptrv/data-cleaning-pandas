# Cleaning and analysing shark data

In this project you will find two jupyter-notebooks; 
    - Clean
    - Analyse
    
Clean : I have cleaned a dataframe of shark attacks in order to make eliminate confusing data, avoid nulls, adding new columns, etc. The objetivo was to create a final version of the dataframe with the necessary information to check our hypthesis. 

Analyse : I have analysed the information of my clean version of the dataframe in order to prove my hypothesis in a visual representation using different graphs. 

The hypthoses: 
"There are more attacks during winter than summer as sharks are more agressive due to their mating season."

I hope you find the information of good use ;)
